# Ideas

Rainbow - sail to the end of the rainbow and get a prize, but only at the right end of the rainbow, on the other end you'll find enemies
Merchant Ship - 
Refugee Ship - 
Military Ship - 
Big fuckoff but friendly underwater creature "moving island" -
Shipwreck in progress - players come across a ship that has struck a sandbank or has limped away from combat and is actively sinking and the players have to figure out a way to help 
Recent Shipwreck - fresh corpses, may or may not still be somebody onboard
Small island marked with 'X' - has "suspicious pirate loot place" written all over it
Ancient Shipwreck - loot 
Confused Dwarfs - on a raft made of barrels, very hungover, very confuzzled
Merfolk meeting -
Shallow Underwater Shrine - 
Beautiful Corral Reef - 
"Water Dragon" Meeting - 
Sparkly lights underwater (only at night) - 
Darkness - Everything goes black, there's something in the sky, quick moving shadow
