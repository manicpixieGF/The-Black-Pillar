## Overview

Ghost Ship, where we fight undead for the first time and the last time for a while
Person at harbor will warn party that there's a ghost ship hunting down ships with powerful people, and to be wary, and also give quest that a powerful elven lord is offering a reward for dealing ghost ship (actually the elven noble trying to get revenge for his slain children.) Rumor: Ghost ship goes after ships with adventurers on them. People are unsure whether it's related to [[The Black Pillar]]

## Background



## Additional Details

Different ways to approach this:
Ship vs Ship 
Ship Combat 
-

Expected Path: Players shooting at the ship
Shoot ship, ship hails them and asks to duel, option to keep shooting or go in to duel or try to escape and sneak back stealth style
Ship Motivation: seeks out strong opponents to test itself
Ways To Convince:
Duels
Convince the ghostship to leave - get in a conversation and tell about elves being after it 

Optimal Solution for world at large is to get ship to join war 

Average ship crew:
[[Zombie]]
CR: 12 Eidolon

Want players to get on the ship and see weaksauce little guy and then big fuckoff guys and just tremble when seeing the range the ship is capable of.

Running Away: Just doing the duel at actually
Joining War: Proving that you're strong, and talking (proving that [[The Black Pillar]] is a worthy opponent)

Ghostship = Female
If trying to seduce, get challenged to 1v1 and if succeed, seduced. Bottom with high standards

TO DO: 
Look up pirate lingo
