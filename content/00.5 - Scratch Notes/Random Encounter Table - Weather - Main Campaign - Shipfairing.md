# Ideas
Rainstorm - most common - 5 - wet 
Thunderstorm - fourth most common - 2 - darkness, lightning strikes, either evade with dex checks or ship gets set on fire
Hailstorm - Third most common - 3 - make dex or con checks to avoid taking small damage, disadvantage perception/hearing
Fog - third most common - 4 - disadvantage on checks for being frightened, disadvantage on checks in general
Windstorm - second most common - 4 - Reduced movement speed, disadvantage on checks to try to move in the same direction
Eerie Stillness - least common - 1 - sails = 0 movement, must row to move, disadvantage on ship crew checks, eerie things might happen (might be attacked by a ghost ship or other things)23
Tropical - least common - 1 - effects of everything that says storm
